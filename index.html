          <span class="headline hl3">Cracking down on Crime in Chichester</span>

        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}> Since 2010, with the exception of fraud, we have seen crime cut by 55 per cent. Meanwhile neighbourhood crime has reduced by 51 per cent. This is a great testament to our police force, particularly in Sussex where our local Police and Crime Plan seeks to target the issues that affect the quality of life for all residents, including tackling anti-social behaviour, shoplifting and dangerous driving.  </p> In addition, since 2019 over 500 more officers have joined Sussex Police thanks to the Government's national recruitment drive. This means more police on our streets helping to keep you safe.  </p> As MP for Chichester I have led on initiatives to stop criminals in our area, from founding the Rural Crime Taskforce to working with our police to crack down on dangerous driving. </p> However, speaking to shopkeepers and workers across Chichester I know that many do continue to be impacted by crime such as theft and abuse, particularly after Chichester District Council made cuts to CCTV in the city centre last year.  </p> That is why I'm pleased that this week the Government has launched a tough crackdown on these offences through a raft of new measures.  </a> </View> </p>

        Assaulting a retail worker will be made a standalone criminal offence in the Criminal Justice Bill. Perpetrators could be sent to prison for up to 6 months, receive an unlimited fine and be banned from going back to the shop where they committed their crimes.  </p> The Government is also stepping up action to clamp down on offenders who repeatedly target the country’s high streets, with serial offenders forced to wear tags to track their movements.  </p> Finally, an additional £55.5 million has been made available for facial recognition technology to identify offenders and disrupt organised crime. This will include £4 million for bespoke mobile units that can be deployed to high streets across the country with live facial recognition used in crowded areas to identify people wanted by the police. </p> I raised residents’ concerns about shoplifting and other issues relating to anti-social behaviour at a recent meeting with our excellent Police and Crime Commissioner, Katy Bourne. She and I take this very seriously, and our neighbourhood policing teams have stepped up patrols in hotspot areas to act as a deterrent to criminals.  </p> You can play your part too by reporting any concerns you have to Sussex Police on 101 or via their website: <a href="https://www.sussex.police.uk/"> www.sussex.police.uk.</a> .
