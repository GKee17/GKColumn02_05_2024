        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}> It’s pay day for many people in Chichester this week – a welcome time of the month for us all. This month all workers who pay National Insurance (NICs) will have had an extra boost to their pay packets following the further two per cent reduction in contributions announced at the Budget in March.  </p> Alongside our cut to NICs in January, the average worker earning a salary of £35,000 will be £900 better off this year. Those who are self-employed will also be £650 better off this year thanks to cuts to Class 4 National insurance. </p> It’s real-terms benefits such as these tax cuts that are evidence that our economic plan is working for people in Chichester and across the country. </p> I held some productive meetings in the constituency last Friday, including with residents from West and East Ashling and Funtington. We discussed the ongoing problems they are experiencing with the traveller community in their area and the practical steps I will be taking to ensure that this is dealt with and that we clamp down on any illegal activity. </p> We also discussed the work currently ongoing to seal pipes around Funtington to stop sewage leaks which are impacting the environment. This in turn will help to relieve pressure on water treatment works at Bosham.  </a> </View> </p>

        I also held a meeting with the Bosham Association, a group dedicated to protecting the character of a beautiful area with a particular concern for the fragile harbour environment. </p> We discussed their very real concerns about uncontrolled housing development in the area. Many of these problems stem from a lack of progress on passing our Local Plan from Chichester District Council which, at the time of writing, remains unpublished. All the while, special communities such as Bosham and the Manhood Peninsula remain at the mercy of developers. </p> Finally, if you’re reading this on Thursday this is your reminder to vote in our local Police and Crime Commissioner elections. You will need a valid form of photo ID to vote this time, so please do check on the Electoral Commission’s website in advance so that you have all that you need. </a> .
