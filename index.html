        <View style={{flexDirection:'row'}}> <Text style={{flex: 1, flexWrap: 'wrap'}}> In the build up to Easter it was great to join the children and staff of Little Blue Door nursery in Chichester city centre for their Easter bonnet parade. Their brightly decorated hats and spring flowers were a reminder that, despite the unpredictable April weather, brighter and warmer days will soon be with us. </p> My visit to Little Blue Door was also a chance to chat to parents about the largest ever expansion of free childcare that the government has rolled out this week. </p> For too long, many parents have had to make the difficult choice between having children and having a career. This is something I hear often, especially from many women, and is a situation I’m determined to change.  </p> On Monday we took the next step towards this by giving working parents of two-year-olds access to 15 hours of government-funded childcare a week. This will benefit over 150,000 families across the country, including many in Chichester. </p>Those I spoke to at Little Blue Door were excited not just for this week’s changes, but also the long-term benefits of our expanded childcare offer for parents. By September 2025 parents will be able to access 30 hours of free childcare from the end of maternity leave to when their child starts school, saving families an average of £6,900 per year and helping many return to work or take on a few extra hours.  </a> </View> </p>

         And it’s not just early years we’re focussing on. Last week also saw a massive increase in local funding for children with special educational needs. </p. West Sussex County Council will receive an additional £13.8 million of funding to ensure children with special educational needs and disabilities (SEND) receive an education that properly meets their needs. </p> This is on top of the proposed expansion of St Anthony’s School and Fordwater Special School in Chichester, and a new 140 place SEND school coming soon to West Sussex. </p> I've seen first-hand in my own family how complex and stressful navigating the special educational needs system can be for parents, so providing better support is a personal mission for me. </p> I know that there is still more to do to ensure children with special educational needs get the support they deserve - but I'm really pleased that we are taking these important steps to improve the situation for children in Chichester for the future.
